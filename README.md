# HTN-AI (Demo-PC) 

•	3-D Demo made in Unity

•	Procedural level generation

•	Automated Planning and Scheduling for enemy AI

An enemy AI roams a cave filled with rocks and crates obstacles. Their placement is procedurally generated. The enemy possesses passive and aggressive behavior that is controlled by a Hierarchical Task Network with a forward planner. The actions of the enemy are validated or rejected by evaluating a world state vector at planning and execution stages.

The player can defend himself with his shield (press spacebar) and win by stealing the tresure.
